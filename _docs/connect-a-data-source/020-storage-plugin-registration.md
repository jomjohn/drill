# Storage Plugin Registration
You connect Drill to a file system, Hive, HBase, or other data source through a storage plugin. On the Storage tab of the Drill Web Console, you can view and reconfigure a storage plugin. If [HTTPS support]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-web-console-and-rest-api-security/#https-support) is not enabled (the default), go to `http://<IP address>:8047/storage` to view and configure a storage plugin. IP address is the host name or IP address of one of the installed Drillbits in a distributed system or `localhost` in an embedded system. If HTTPS support is enabled, go to `https://<IP address>:8047/storage`. 

<!--  DOC NOTE: change when feature added in 1.5?: If HTTPS support is enabled and you are [authorized]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-web-console-and-rest-api-security/) to view and configure a storage plugin, go to -->

The Drill installation registers the `cp`, `dfs`, `hbase`, `hive`, and `mongo` default storage plugin configurations.

* `cp`  
  Points to JAR files in the Drill classpath, such as [`employee.json`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/querying-json-files/) that you can query. 
* `dfs`  
  Points to the local file system, but you can configure this storage plugin to
point to any distributed file system, such as a Hadoop or S3 file system. 
* `hbase`  
   Provides a connection to HBase.
* `hive`  
   Integrates Drill with the Hive metadata abstraction of files, HBase, and libraries to read data and operate on SerDes and UDFs.
* `mongo`  
   Provides a connection to MongoDB data.

In the [Drill sandbox]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/about-the-mapr-sandbox/), the `dfs` storage plugin configuration connects you to a Hadoop environment pre-configured with Drill. If you install Drill, `dfs` connects you to the root of your file system.

## Registering a Storage Plugin Configuration

To register a new storage plugin configuration, enter a storage name, click **CREATE**, provide a configuration in JSON format, and click **UPDATE**. 

<!-- In Drill 1.2 and later, updating a storage plugin configuration and other storage plugin tasks require [authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-web-console-and-rest-api-security/) if security is enabled. -->

## Storage Plugin Configuration Persistence

Drill saves storage plugin configurations in a temporary directory (embedded mode) or in ZooKeeper (distributed mode). For example, on Mac OS X, Drill uses `/tmp/drill/sys.storage_plugins` to store storage plugin configurations. The temporary directory clears when you reboot. When you run drill in embedded mode, add the sys.store.provider.local.path option to the drill-override.conf file and the path for storing the plugin configurations. For example:

     drill.exec: {
     	cluster-id: "drillbits1",
     	zk.connect: "localhost:2181",
     	sys.store.provider.local.path="/mypath"
     }

<!-- Enabling authorization to protect this data through the Web Console and REST API does not include protection for the data in the tmp directory or in ZooKeeper. 

DOCS NOTE: See Drill-3780 and 3949

The storage plugin configuration persists after upgrading, so authorized users can see a configuration that you created in one version of Drill in the Drill Web Console of an upgraded version of Drill. To revert to the default storage plugins for a particular version, in embedded mode, delete the contents of this directory and restart the Drill shell. -->

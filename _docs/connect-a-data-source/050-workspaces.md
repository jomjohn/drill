You can define one or more workspaces in a [storage plugin configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/plugin-configuration-basics/). The workspace defines the location of files in subdirectories of a local or distributed file system. Drill searches the workspace to locate data when
you run a query. A hidden default workspace, `dfs.default`, points to the root of the file system.

The following `dfs` storage plugin configuration shows some examples of defined workspaces:

       {
         "type": "file",
         "enabled": true,
         "connection": "file:///",
         "workspaces": {
           "root": {
             "location": "/",
             "writable": false,
             "defaultInputFormat": null
           },
           "tmp": {
             "location": "/tmp",
             "writable": true,
             "defaultInputFormat": null
           },
           "emp": {
             "location": "/Users/user1/emp",
             "writable": true,
             "defaultInputFormat": null
           },
           "donuts": {
             "location": "/Users/user1/donuts",
             "writable": true,
             "defaultInputFormat": null
           },
           "sales": {
             "location": "/Users/user1/sales",
             "writable": true,
             "defaultInputFormat": null
           }
         },
Configuring workspaces to include a subdirectory simplifies the query, which is important when querying the same files repeatedly. After you configure a long path name in the workspace `location` property, instead of
using the full path name to the data source, you use dot notation in the FROM
clause.

``<workspace name>.`<location>```

Where `<location>` is the path name of a subdirectory, such as `/users/max/drill/json` enclosed in double quotation marks as shown in the ["Querying Donuts Example."](/docs/file-system-storage-plugin/#querying-donuts-example)

To query the data source when you have not set the default schema name to the storage plugin configuration, include the plugin name. This syntax assumes you did not issue a USE statement to connect to a storage plugin that defines the
location of the data:

``<plugin>.<workspace name>.`<location>```  

##Overriding `dfs.default`

You may want to override the hidden default workspace in scenarios where users do not have permissions to access the root directory. 
Add the following workspace entry to the `dfs` storage plugin configuration to override the default workspace:

    "default": {
      "location": "</directory/path>",
      "writable": true,
      "defaultInputFormat": null
    }


## No Workspaces for Hive and HBase

You cannot include workspaces in the configurations of the
`hive` and `hbase` plugins installed with Apache Drill, though Hive databases show up as workspaces in
Drill. Each `hive` storage plugin configuration includes a `default` workspace that points to the  Hive metastore. When you query
files and tables in the `hive default` workspaces, you can omit the
workspace name from the query.

For example, you can issue a query on a Hive table in the `default workspace`
using either of the following queries and get the same results:

**Example**

    SELECT * FROM hive.customers LIMIT 10;
    SELECT * FROM hive.`default`.customers LIMIT 10;

{% include startnote.html %}Default is a reserved word. You must enclose reserved words when used as identifiers in back ticks.{% include endnote.html %}

Because the HBase storage plugin does not accommodate a workspace, you can use the following
query:

    SELECT * FROM hbase.customers LIMIT 10;

# LIMIT Clause
The LIMIT clause limits the result set to the specified number of rows. You can use LIMIT with or without an ORDER BY clause.


## Syntax
The LIMIT clause supports the following syntax:  

       LIMIT { count | ALL }

Specifying ALL returns all records, which is equivalent to omitting the LIMIT clause from the SELECT statement.

## Parameters
*count*  
Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
If the count expression evaluates to NULL, Drill treats it as LIMIT ALL. 

## Examples
The following example query includes the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses and returns the top 20 sales totals by month and state:  

       0: jdbc:drill:> SELECT `month`, state, SUM(order_total)
       AS sales FROM orders GROUP BY `month`, state
       ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT 20;
       +------------+------------+------------+
       |   month    |   state    |   sales    |
       +------------+------------+------------+

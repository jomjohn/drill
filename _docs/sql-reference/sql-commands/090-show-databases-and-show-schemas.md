The SHOW DATABASES and SHOW SCHEMAS commands generate a list of available Drill schemas that you can query.

## Syntax

The SHOW DATABASES and SHOW SCHEMAS commands support the following syntax:

    SHOW DATABASES;
    SHOW SCHEMAS;

{% include startnote.html %}These commands generate the same results.{% include endnote.html %}

## Usage Notes

You may want to run the SHOW DATABASES or SHOW SCHEMAS command to see a list of the configured storage plugins and workspaces in Drill before you issue the USE command to switch to a particular schema for your queries.

In Drill, a database or schema is a storage plugin configuration that can include a workspace. For example, in `dfs.donuts`, `dfs` is the configured file system and donuts the workspace. The workspace points to a directory
within the file system.

You can configure and use multiple storage plugins and workspaces in Drill.  See [Storage Plugin Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/storage-plugin-registration) and [Workspaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/workspaces).

## Example

The following example uses the SHOW DATABASES and SHOW SCHEMAS commands to generate a list of the available schemas in Drill. Some of the results that display are specific to all Drill installations, such as `cp.default` and `dfs.default`, while others vary based on your specific storage plugin and workspace configurations.

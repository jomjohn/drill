  * IS NULL
  * IS NOT NULL

## Examples
The following query compares order totals where the states are California and New York:  

       0: jdbc:drill:> SELECT o1.cust_id, sum(o1.order_total) AS ny_sales,
       (SELECT SUM(o2.order_total) FROM hive.orders o2
       WHERE o1.cust_id=o2.cust_id and state='ca') AS ca_sales
       FROM hive.orders o1 WHERE o1.state='ny' GROUP BY o1.cust_id
       ORDER BY cust_id LIMIT 20;

The following query uses a workspace named `dfw.views` and joins a view named “custview” with a hive table named “orders” to determine sales for each membership type:

       0: jdbc:drill:> select membership, sum(order_total) as sales from hive.orders, custview
       where orders.cust_id=custview.cust_id
       group by membership order by 2;
       +------------+------------+
       | membership |   sales    |
       +------------+------------+
       | "basic"    | 380665     |
       | "silver"   | 708438     |
       | "gold"     | 2787682    |
       +------------+------------+

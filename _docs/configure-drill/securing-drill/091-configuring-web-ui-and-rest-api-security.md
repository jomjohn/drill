# Configuring Web Console and REST API Security
Drill 1.5 extends [Drill user security]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-security/) to the Web Console and underlying REST API. As administrator, you can control the extent of access to the Web Console and REST API client applications. For example,
you can limit the access of certain users to Web Console functionality, such as viewing the in-progress or completed queries of other users. You can limit users from viewing other users' query profiles, who can cancel queries of other users, and other functionality.

With Web Console security in place, users who do not have administrator privileges need to use the SHOW SCHEMAS command instead of the Web Console for storage plugin configuration information.

## HTTPS Support
Drill 1.2 uses code-level support for transport layer security (TLS) to secure the Web Console and REST API. By default, the Web Console and REST API support the HTTP protocol. You set the following start-up option to TRUE to enable HTTPS support:

`drill.exec.http.ssl_enabled`

By default this start-up option is set to FALSE.

Drill generates a self-signed certificate that works with SSL for HTTPS access to the Web Console. Because Drill uses a self-signed certificate, you see a warning in the browser when you go to `https://<node IP address>:8047`. The Chrome browser, for example, requires you to click `Advanced`, and then `Proceed to <address> (unsafe)`. If you have a signed certificate by an authority, you can set up a custom SSL to avoid this warning. You can set up SSL to specify the keystore or truststore, or both, for your organization, as described in the next section.

## Setting Up a Custom SSL Configuration

As cluster administrator, you can set the following SSL configuration parameters in the `conf/drill-override.conf` file, as described in the [Java product documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html/#Customization):

* javax.net.ssl.keyStore  
  Path to the application's certificate and private key in the Java keystore file.  
* javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword  
  Password for accessing the private key from the keystore file.  
* javax.net.ssl.trustStore  
  Path to the trusted CA certificates in a keystore file.  
* javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword  
  Password for accessing the trusted keystore file.
 
## Prerequisites for Web Console and REST API Security

You need to perform the following configuration tasks using Web Console and REST API security.  

* Configure [user security]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-security/)  
* Set up Web Console administrators  
  Optionally, you can set up Web Console administrator-user groups to facilitate management of multiple Web Console administrators.

## Setting up Web Console Administrators and Administrator-User Groups

Configure the following system options using the [ALTER SYSTEM]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/alter-system/) command:

* security.admin.users  
  Set the value of this option to a comma-separated list of user names who you want to give administrator privileges, such as changing system options.  
* security.admin.user_groups  
  Set the value of this option to a comma-separated list of administrator groups.

Any user who is a member of any group listed in security.admin.user.groups is a Drill cluster administrator. Any user for whom you have configured Drill user authentication, but not set up as a Drill cluster administrator, has only user privileges to access the Web Console and REST API client applications.

## Web Console and REST API Privileges

The following table and subsections describe the privilege levels for accessing the REST API methods and corresponding Web Console functions:

* Administrator (ADMIN)  
* User (USER)  
* Administrator and User (ALL)

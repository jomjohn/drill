# Securing Drill Introduction

Before connecting to a data source, you can configure Drill security features and [secure communication pathways]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/secure-communication-paths/) to a secure Drill cluster.  Security features include:

- **Authentication** - Drill supports user authentication to secure clusters with:
    -  Kerberos. 
		See [Configuring Kerberos Security]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-kerberos-security/).
	- Username and password (with the Plain mechanism or a Custom Authenticator). See: 
		- [Configuring Plain Security]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-plain-security/)  
		- [Creating Custom Authenticators]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/creating-custom-authenticators)
	- Digest
- **Encryption** - Drill supports client-to-drillbit encryption with Kerberos to ensure date confidentiality and integrity in Drill 1.11. See [Configuring Kerberos Security]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-kerberos-security/).
- **Authorization** - Drill supports restricting an authenticated user's capabilities.
		See [Configuring User Impersonation with Hive Authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-impersonation-with-hive-authorization/).
- **Impersonation** - Drill executes queries on behalf of a client while performing the action requested by the client. See: 
	- [Configuring User Impersonation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-impersonation/).  
	- [Configuring Inbound Impersonation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-inbound-impersonation/) 
	- [Configuring User Impersonation with Hive Authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-impersonation-with-hive-authorization/)

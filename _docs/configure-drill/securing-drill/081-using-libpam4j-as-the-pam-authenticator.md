# Using libpam4j as the PAM Authenticator


The libpam4j module is packaged with Drill. The libpam4j module does not have any external dependencies.  

To use libpam4j as the PAM authenticator with Drill, complete the following steps:

1. Add the following configuration to the `drill.exec` block in the `<DRILL_HOME>/conf/drill-override.conf` file:  
  
              drill.exec: {
               cluster-id: "drillbits1",
               zk.connect: "<zk-node-hostname>:2181,<zk-node-hostname>:2181,<zk-node-hostname>:2181",
               impersonation: {
                 enabled: true,
                 max_chained_user_hops: 3
               },
               security: {          
                       auth.mechanisms : ["PLAIN"],
                        },
               security.user.auth: {
                       enabled: true,
                       packages += "org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.user.security",
                       impl: "pam4j",
                       pam_profiles: [ "sudo", "login" ]
                }
              }

2. (Optional) To add or remove different PAM profiles, add or delete the profile names in the `pam_profiles` array in the configuration.
3. Restart the Drillbit process on each Drill node, as shown:  

              <DRILLINSTALL_HOME>/bin/drillbit.sh restart

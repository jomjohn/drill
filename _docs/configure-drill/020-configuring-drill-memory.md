# Configuring Drill Memory

You can configure the amount of direct memory allocated to a Drillbit for query processing in any Drill cluster, multitenant or not. The default memory for a drillbit is 8G, but Drill prefers 16G or more depending on the workload. The total amount of direct memory that a drillbit allocates to query operations cannot exceed the limit set.

Drill uses Java direct memory and performs well when executing operations in memory instead of storing the operations on disk. Drill does not write to disk unless absolutely necessary, unlike MapReduce where everything is written to disk during each phase of a job.

The JVM’s heap memory does not limit the amount of direct memory available in
a drillbit. The on-heap memory for Drill is typically set at 4-8G (default is 4), which should
suffice because Drill avoids having data sit in heap memory.

As of Drill 1.5, Drill uses a new allocator that improves an operator’s use of direct memory and tracks the memory use more accurately. Due to this change, the sort operator (in queries that ran successfully in previous releases) may not have enough memory, resulting in a failed query and out of memory error instead of spilling to disk.     


## Drillbit Memory  
The value set for the [`planner.memory.max_query_memory_per_node`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuration-options-introduction/#system-options) system option sets the maximum amount of direct memory allocated to the Sort and Hash Aggreate operators in each query on a node. If a query plan contains multiple Sort and/or Hash Aggregate operators, they all share this memory. The default limit is set to 2147483648 bytes (2GB), which should be increased for queries on large data sets. If you encounter memory issues when running queries with Sort and/or Hash Aggregate operators, increase the value of this option. See [Sort-Based and Hash-Based Memory Constrained Operators](https://drill.apache.org/docs/sort-based-and-hash-based-memory-constrained-operators/) for more information.  

If you continue to encounter memory issues after increasing this value, you can also reduce the value of the [`planner.width.max_per_node`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuration-options-introduction/) option to reduce the level of parallelism per node. However, this may increase the amount of time required for a query to complete. 

###Modifying Drillbit Memory

You can modify memory for each drillbit node in your cluster. To modify the memory for a drillbit, set the DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY variable in the drillbit startup script, `drill-env.sh`, located in `<drill_installation_directory>/conf`, as follows:

    export DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY=${DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY:-"<value>"}

{% include startnote.html %}If DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY is not set, the limit depends on the amount of available system memory.{% include endnote.html %}

After you edit `<drill_installation_directory>/conf/drill-env.sh`, [restart the drillbit]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/starting-drill-in-distributed-mode) on the node.

### About the Drillbit Startup Script

The `drill-env.sh` file contains the following options:

    #export DRILL_HEAP=${DRILL_HEAP:-"4G”}  
    #export DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY=${DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY:-"8G"}

To customize memory limits, uncomment the line needed and change the setting:  

    export DRILL_HEAP=${DRILL_HEAP:-"<limit>”}
    export DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY=${DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY:-“<limit>"}  

DRILL_MAX_HEAP is the maximum theoretical heap limit for the JVM per node.  
DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY is the Java direct memory limit per node.  

If performance is an issue, add -Dbounds=false, as shown in the following example:

    export DRILL_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILL_JAVA_OPTS -Dbounds=false"  

As of Drill 1.13, bounds checking for direct memory is disabled by default. To enable bounds checking for direct memory, use the DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS variable to pass the `drill.exec.memory.enable_unsafe_bounds_check` parameter in $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh, as shown:  

    export DRILL_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILL_JAVA_OPTS -Ddrill.exec.memory.enable_unsafe_bounds_check=true"  


For earlier versions of Drill (prior to 1.13), bounds checking is enabled by default. To disable bounds checking, set the `drill.enable_unsafe_memory_access` parameter to true, as shown:  


    export DRILL_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILL_JAVA_OPTS -Ddrill.enable_unsafe_memory_access=true"

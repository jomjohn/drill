# Configuring the Drill Shell
After [starting the Drill shell]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/starting-drill-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/), you can type queries on the shell command line. At the Drill shell command prompt, typing "help" lists the configuration and other options you can set to manage shell functionality. Apache Drill 1.0 and later formats the resultset output tables for readability if possible. In this release, columns having 70 characters or more cannot be formatted. This document formats all output for readability and example purposes.

Formatting tables takes time, which you might notice if running a huge query using the default `outputFormat` setting, which is `table` of the Drill shell. You can set another, more performant table formatting such as `csv`, as shown in the [examples]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-the-drill-shell/#examples-of-configuring-the-drill-shell).

## Example of Hiding the Password When Starting Drill

When starting Drill in authentication mode, you can use the **!connect** command as shown in the section, ["User Authentication Process"]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-user-authentication/#user-authentication-process), instead of using a command such as **sqlline**, **drill-embedded**, or **drill-conf** commands. For example, after running the sqlline script, you enter this command to connect to Drill:

`sqlline> !connect jdbc:drill:zk=localhost:2181`  

When prompted you enter a user name and password, which is hidden as you type it.

## Examples of Configuring the Drill Shell

For example, quit the Drill shell:

    0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> !quit

List the current connections. 

    0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> !list
    1 active connection:
     #0  open     jdbc:drill:zk=local

Set the maximum width of the Drill shell to 10000.

     0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> !set maxwidth 10000

Set the output format to CSV to improve performance of a huge query.

     0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> !set outputFormat csv

### autoCommit

Drill performs read-only operations primarily, and autocommits writes. Drill JDBC throws an exception if autoCommit is disabled.

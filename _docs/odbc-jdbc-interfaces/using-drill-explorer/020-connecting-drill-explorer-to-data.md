# Connecting Drill Explorer to Data
The way you start Drill Explorer differs depending on your platform, but regardless of the platform, Drill must be running. 

## Connecting Drill Explorer to Data on Linux

You need an X-11 XDisplay to use Drill Explorer on Linux. Run the DrillExplorer executable in `/opt/mapr/drillodbc/DrillExplorer`, and then follow instructions from step 2 in the next section, *Connecting Drill Explorer to Data on Mac OS X*.

## Connecting Drill Explorer to Data on Mac OS X

1. On a node that is running Drill, run Drill Explorer.  The Drill Explorer app is located in the `/Applications` directory. The Drill Explorer console appears. 
 
2. Click **Connect** on the console. The Drill Explorer dialog appears.

3. If you connect through a DSN, select the name of the DSN you configured on the **ODBC DSN** tab. For example, select **MapR Drill**. Alternatively, if you use a DSN-less connection, type a connection string in the text box on the **Advanced** tab.. For example, type the following connection string:  
 
         DRIVER=MapR Drill ODBC Driver;AdvancedProperties={HandshakeTimeout=0;QueryTimeout=0;TimestampTZDisplayTimezone=utc;ExcludedSchemas=sys, INFORMATION_SCHEMA;};Catalog=DRILL;Schema=;ConnectionType=ZooKeeper;ZKQuorum=192.168.39.43:5181;ZKClusterID=drillbits1

5. If you set the Authentication Type property to **Plain** (or Basic Authentication), which enables impersonation, respond to the prompt for a user name and password.

4. Click **Connect** in the dialog. In the **Schemas** panel, the schema for the connected data source appear.

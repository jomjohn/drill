# Logging and Tracing

## Logging Options

Only enable logging long enough to capture information required to resolve an issue. Logging decreases performance and can consume a large quantity of disk space.

If logging is enabled, the Drill ODBC driver logs events in the following log files in the log path that you configure:

* `driver.log` provides a log of driver events.
* `drillclient.log` provides a log of the Drill client events.

### Logging Levels

The following log levels are available:

* (0) OFF: Disables logging.
* (1) FATAL: Logs severe error events that may cause the driver to stop running.
* (2) ERROR: Logs error events that may allow the driver to continue running.
* (3) WARNING: Logs events that might result in an error if action is not taken.
* (4) INFO: Logs general information that describes the progress of the driver.
* (5) DEBUG: Logs detailed events that may help to debug issues.
* (6) TRACE: Logs all driver activity, which includes more fine-grained events than the DEBUG level.

### Non-Windows Platforms

On non-Windows platforms, logging is configured through the driver-wide settings in the `mapr.drillodbc.ini` file, which apply to all connections using the driver. 


#### Enable Logging

To enable logging:

1. Open the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file in a text editor. (On Mac OS X, the default installation will install a .mapr.drillodbc.ini to $HOME.)

2. Set the **LogLevel** key to the desired level of information to include in log files. 
For example:

      `LogLevel=2`

3. Set the **LogPath** key to the full path to the folder where you want to save log files. 
For example:  

      `LogPath=/localhome/employee/logs`

4. Save the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file. The Drill ODBC Driver produces two log files at the location you specify using the **Log Path** field:  
   * `driver.log` provides a log of driver activities.
   * `drillclient.log` provides a log of Drill client activities.

 
6. Restart the applciation to make sure that the new settings take effect. Configuration changes will not be picked up until the application reloads the driver.

#### Disable Logging

To disable logging:

1. Open the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file in a text editor.
2. Set the **LogLevel** key to zero (`0`).
3. Save the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file.  
4. Restart your ODBC application to make sure that the new settings take effect.

### Windows Platforms

On Windows, logging is available in the Windows **ODBC Data Source Administrator** where you created the DSN. You must run `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe` to access and modify 32-bit DSNs on 64-bit Windows.

#### Enable Logging

To enable logging:

1. Click **Start**, **All Programs**, and then click the program group corresponding to the driver. 

2. Select the DSN for which you want to log activity.  

3. Click **Configure**. 

4. In the **DSN Setup** dialog box, click **Logging Options**.
 
6. From the **Log Level** drop-down list, select the logging level corresponding to the amount of information that you want to include in log files.
7. In the **Log Path** (or Log Directory) field, specify the full path to the folder where you want to save log files. 

8. If necessary (for example, if requested by a Support team), type the name of the component for which to log messages in the **Log Namespace** field. Otherwise, do not type a value in the field.
9. Click **OK** to close the Logging Options dialog box.

7. Click **OK** to save your settings and close the **DSN Configuration** dialog box. Configuration changes will not be saved of picked up by the driver until you have clicked **OK** in the **DSN Configuration **dialog box. Click **Cancel** (or the X button) to discard changes.

8. Restart the application to make sure that the new settings take effect. Configuration changes will not be picked up by until the application reloads the driver.


#### Disable Logging

To disable logging:

1. Select the DSN. 
2. Click **Configure**. 
3. Click **Logging Options**.
4. From the **Log Level** drop-down list, select **LOG_OFF**.
5. Click **OK**. 
6. Restart your ODBC application to make sure that the new settings take effect. 

## Driver Manager Tracing

The driver manager trace facility, is a useful way to troubleshoot ODBC driver issues.You can choose from several driver managers, depending on which platform you use.

{% include startimportant.html %}Tracing is active only for applications started after tracing has started. Currently-executing applications will not have tracing enabled. You must restart applications to enable tracing. You may need to restart services for applications, or you may have to restart the machine to properly enable tracing.{% include endimportant.html %}


### OSX and Other Non-Windows Platforms

iODBC is the default driver manager on OSX and can sometimes be found on other non-Windows platforms. 


#### Enable Trace Logging

To enable trace logging:

1. Locate your `maprdrill.odbc.ini` file. This often located in your home directory. It might be a hidden file.
2. Open the file and add the following key-value pairs under the section heading **[ODBC]**. If the heading does not exist, add it. For example:
	
	`[ODBC]`

	`Trace=1`

	`TraceFile=/path/to/file/traceFile.log`

	`[ODBC Data Sources]`

#### Disable Trace Logging

When the trace is complete, disable tracing because tracing will consume disk space and significantly impact performance.

1. Locate your `maprdrill.odbc.ini` file. This often located in your home directory. It might be a hidden file.
2. Open the file and add the following key-value pairs under the section heading **[ODBC]**. For example:

	`[ODBC]`

	`Trace=0`

	`TraceFile=/path/to/file/traceFile.log`

	`[ODBC Data Sources]`

1. (Again, this action will only impact applications that have just started, not currently-executing applications.) Restart your application.


### OSX and Other Non-Windows Platforms

#### Enable Trace Logging

To enable tracing on Windows:

1. Open the **ODBC Data Source Administrator**. 
1. Go to the **Tracing** tab.


![logtrace]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/img/odbctrace.png)


1. Change the **Log File Path** field to be the location and name of the file to which youâ€™d like to write the trace entries.


1. (Optional) Check **Machine-wide tracing** for all user identities if you want the tracing to affect all users on the machine. If you are unsure, check this box.


1. Press **Start Tracing Now**. 

#### Disable Trace Logging

When the trace is complete, disable tracing because tracing will consume disk space and significantly impact performance.

1. Open the **ODBC Data Source Administrator**. 
1. Go to the **Tracing** tab.
1. Press Stop **Tracing Now**.  (Again, this action will only impact applications that have just started, not currently-executing applications.)
1. Restart your application.

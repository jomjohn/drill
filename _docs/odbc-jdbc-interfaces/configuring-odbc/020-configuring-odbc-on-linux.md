# Configuring ODBC on Linux

ODBC driver managers use configuration files to define and configure ODBC data
sources and drivers. To configure an ODBC connection for Linux, complete the following
steps:

* [Step 1: Set Environment Variables]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-odbc-on-linux/#step-1:-set-environment-variables)
* [Step 2: Define the ODBC Data Sources in odbc.ini]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-odbc-on-linux/#step-2:-define-the-odbc-data-sources-in-.odbc.ini)
* [Step 3: (Optional) Define the ODBC Driver in .odbcinst.ini]({{site.baseurl}}/configuring-odbc-on-linux/#step-3:-(optional)-define-the-odbc-driver-in-.odbcinst.ini)
* [Step 4: Configure the Drill ODBC Driver]({{site.baseurl}}/configuring-odbc-on-linux/#step-4:-configure-the-drill-odbc-driver)

## Sample Configuration Files

Before you connect to Drill through an ODBC client tool
on Linux, copy the following configuration files in `/opt/mapr/drill/Setup` to your home directory unless the files already exist in your home directory:

* `mapr.drillodbc.ini`
* `odbc.ini`
* `odbcinst.ini`

In your home directory, rename the files as hidden files. Use sudo if necessary:

* `.mapr.drillodbc.ini`
* `.odbc.ini`
* `.odbcinst.ini`

----------

## Step 1: Set Environment Variables 

1. Set the ODBCINI environment variable to point to the `.odbc.ini` in your home directory. 

	Example:  
   `export ODBCINI=~/.odbc.ini`

2. Set the MAPRDRILLINI environment variable to point to `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` in your home directory. 

	Example:  
   `export MAPRDRILLINI=~/.mapr.drillodbc.ini`

3. Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable  to point to your ODBC driver manager libraries. 

	Example:  
   `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`

You can have both 32- and 64-bit versions of the driver installed at the same time on the same computer. 
{% include startimportant.html %}Do not include the paths to both 32- and 64-bit shared libraries in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at the same time.{% include endimportant.html %}
Only include the path to the shared libraries corresponding to the driver matching the bitness of the client application you use to access Drill.

----------

## Step 2: Define the ODBC Data Sources in .odbc.ini

Define the ODBC data sources in the `~/.odbc.ini` configuration file for your environment. To use Drill in embedded mode, set the following properties:

    ConnectionType=Direct
    HOST=localhost
    PORT=31010
    ZKQuorum=
    ZKClusterID=

To use Drill in distributed mode, set the following properties. (These properties are described in detail in the [Direct and ZooKeeper Quorum Properties]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-odbc-on-linux/#direct-and-zookeeper-quorum-properties) section.)

    ConnectionType=ZooKeeper
    HOST=
    PORT=
    ZKQuorum=<host name>:<port>,<host name>:<port> . . . <host name>:<port>
    ZKClusterID=<cluster name in `drill-override.conf`>

The following Linux sample shows a possible configuration for using Drill in distributed mode.

    Schema=

### Authentication Properties
If the Drillbit requires authentication, uncomment the AuthenticationType, add an AuthenticationType, and configure properties. If the Drillbit does not require authentication (or to configure no password protection), you can use the No Authentication option. You do not need to configure additional settings. 

* **Kerberos** 
	*  See the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/" title="MIT Kerberos">MIT Kerberos</a> documentation for installing and configuring a Kerberos environment, which is beyond the scope of the information provided here.  
	*  To specify the Kerberos mechanism:
		* Set the AuthenticationType to Kerberos.
		* Set the KrbServiceHost property to the FQDN of the Drill server host.
		* Set the KrbServiceName property to the Kerberos service principal name of the Drill server.  
		

* **Plain (or Basic Authentication)**
	* Configure the UID to an appropriate name for accessing the Drill server. 
	* Set the PWD property to the password corresponding to the UID. 

### Direct and ZooKeeper Quorum Properties
To use Drill in distributed mode, set ConnectionType to Zookeeper, get the ZKQuorum and ZKClusterID values from the `drill-override.conf` file, and define the ZKQuorum and ZKClusterID properties. The `drill-override.conf` is in the `/drill/drill-<version>/conf` directory. Format ZKQuorum as a comma separated list of ZooKeeper nodes in the following format:  

`<host name/ip address> : <port number>, <host name/ip address> : <port number>, . . .` 

For example:

* `ZKQuorum=centos23:5181,centos28:5181,centos29:5181`  
* `ZKClusterID=docs41cluster-drillbits`

To use Drill in embedded mode, do not define the ZKQuorum and ZKClusterID properties. Start Drill using the drill-localhost command, set ConnectionType to Direct, and define HOST and PORT properties. For example:

* `HOST=<IP address of drillbit>:5181`  
* `PORT=31010`

[Driver Configuration Options]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/odbc-configuration-reference/#configuration-options) describes configuration options available for controlling the
behavior of DSNs using the Drill ODBC Driver.

----------

## Step 3: (Optional) Define the ODBC Driver in .odbcinst.ini

The `.odbcinst.ini` is an optional configuration file that defines the ODBC
Drivers. This configuration file is optional because you can specify drivers
directly in the` .odbc.ini` configuration file. The `.odbinst.ini` file contains the following sample configurations.
  
**Example**

    [ODBC Drivers]
    MapR Drill ODBC Driver 32-bit=Installed
    MapR Drill ODBC Driver 64-bit=Installed

    [MapR Drill ODBC Driver 32-bit]
    Description=MapR Drill ODBC Driver (32-bit)
    Driver=/opt/mapr/lib/32/libdrillodbc_sb32.so

    [MapR Drill ODBC Driver 64-bit]
    Description=MapR Drill ODBC Driver (64-bit)
    Driver=/opt/mapr/lib/64/libdrillodbc_sb64.so 

----------

## Step 4: Configure the Drill ODBC Driver

Configure the Drill ODBC Driver for your environment by modifying the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration
file. This configures the driver to work with your ODBC driver manager. The following sample shows a possible configuration, which you can use as is if you installed the default iODBC driver manager.

**Example**

    . . .
    [Driver]
    DisableAsync=0
    ErrorMessagesPath=/opt/mapr/drill/ErrorMessages
    LogLevel=0
    LogPath=[LogPath]
    SwapFilePath=/tmp

    ## - Note that the path to your ODBC Driver Manager must be specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    . . .

### Configuring .mapr.drillodbc.ini

To configure the Drill ODBC Driver in the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file, complete the following steps:

  1. Open the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file in a text editor.  
 
  2. Edit the DisableAsync setting if you want to enable a synchronous ODBC connection for performance reasons. Change the default 0 to 1 to disable the asynchronous and enable the synchronous connection. A change in state occurs during driver initialization and is propagated to all driver DSNs.  
  
     **Note**: As of version 1.3.8 of the driver, the DriverManagerEncoding setting is automatically detected and set if necessary. The value depends on the driver manager used; it's typically UTF-16 or UTF-32. iODBC uses UTF-32 and unixODBC uses UTF-16. 
    
  3. Save the `.mapr.drillodbc.ini` configuration file.

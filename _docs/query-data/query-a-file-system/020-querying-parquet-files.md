# Querying Parquet Files

The Drill installation includes a `sample-data` directory with Parquet files
that you can query. Use SQL to query the `region.parquet` and
`nation.parquet` files in the `sample-data` directory.

{% include startnote.html %}The Drill installation location may differ from the examples used here.{% include endnote.html %} 

The examples assume that Drill was [installed in embedded mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installing-drill-in-embedded-mode). If you installed Drill in distributed mode, or your `sample-data` directory differs from the location used in the examples. Change the `sample-data` directory to the correct location before you run the queries.

## Region File

To view the data in the `region.parquet` file, issue the following query:

        SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/apache-drill-<version>/sample-data/region.parquet`;

The query returns the following results:

    +--------------+--------------+-----------------------+
    | R_REGIONKEY  |    R_NAME    |       R_COMMENT       |
    +--------------+--------------+-----------------------+

## Nation File

If you followed the Apache Drill in 10 Minutes instructions to install Drill
in embedded mode, the path to the parquet file varies between operating
systems.

To view the data in the `nation.parquet` file, issue the query appropriate for
your operating system:

        SELECT * FROM dfs.`<path-to-installation>/sample-data/nation.parquet`;

The query returns the following results:

    +--------------+-----------------+--------------+-----------------------+

# Drill 1.10 Released

Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.10.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

The release provides the following bug fixes and improvements:

## CTTAS 
The CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE AS (CTTAS) command stores the results of a query in a temporary table. See [CTTAS]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-temporary-table-as-cttas/). 

## Improved Fault Tolerance  
An optional `tries=<value>` parameter included in the JDBC connection string indicates the number of unique drillbits to which the client can try to connect. See [Using the JDBC URL Format for a Direct Drillbit Connection]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/#using-the-jdbc-url-format-for-a-direct-drillbit-connection).    

## Drill Version and Statistics in Web Console
The Web Console displays additional query profile statistics and the Drill version running on each Drill node in the cluster. See [Identifying Multiple Drill Versions in a Cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/identifying-multiple-drill-versions-in-a-cluster).  

## Implicit Interpretation of INT96 
Drill implicitly interprets the INT96 timestamp data type in Parquet files when the new `store.parquet.reader.int96_as_timestamp` option is enabled. See [About INT96 Support]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/parquet-format/#about-int96-support).

## Kerberos Authentication  
Drill supports Kerberos authentication between the client and drillbit. See [Configuring Kerberos Authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-kerberos-authentication/) in the [Securing Drill]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/securing-drill/) section.

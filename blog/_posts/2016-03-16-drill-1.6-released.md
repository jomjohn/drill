# Drill 1.6 Released

Today, we're happy to announce the availability of Drill 1.6.0. You can download it [here](https://drill.apache.org/download/).

The release provides the following bug fixes and improvements:

## Inbound Impersonation  
This feature is useful in a multi-tier architecture where queries must run as the end user instead of the application user. See [Configuring Inbound Impersonation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configuring-inbound-impersonation/).

## Additional Custom Window Frames  
The window function frame clause now supports additional custom frames. See [Window Function Syntax]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/#syntax).
